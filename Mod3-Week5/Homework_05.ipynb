    "\n",

    "1. **Observe** that we have provided the `forward_feature_selection` algorithm from the video notebook for you to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Copy** from the video notebook into the cell indicated below the code that runs forward feature selection and generates a plot (excluding the part that prints the test MSE--we'll do that at the end of this homework). Or write your own version!\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Modify** this code to display the **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** instead of MSE.  \n",
    "   - *Remember*: RMSE is the square root of MSE, which provides results in dollars rather than dollars squared, making the metric more interpretable.  \n",
    "   - Both the plot of RMSE vs. the number of selected features and the printout of the Best CV Score should use RMSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Run** the code on `X_train` and `y_train` (keeping all default settings) to:\n",
    "   - Generate the plot of **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** vs. **Features Added**, and  \n",
    "   - Print the **Best Feature Set** found and the **Best CV RMSE Score**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "- The feature names will be more legible if you increase the size of the plot and change the angle and size of the xticks, e.g.,\n",
    "\n",
    "        plt.xticks(range(1, len(selected_features_forward) + 1), selected_features_forward, rotation=60, ha='right', fontsize=6) \n",
    "\n",
    "- You may wish to change the bounds of the y-axis using `plt.ylim(...)` to better see the behavior around the minimum point."

    "## **Problem Three: Ridge Regression on the Ames Housing Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we will apply Ridge Regression to the Ames Housing dataset. Ridge Regression includes a hyperparameter $\\alpha$ that controls the strength of the regularization penalty, which helps prevent overfitting by constraining the growth of the model’s coefficients. A higher $\\alpha$ penalizes large coefficients more, while a lower $\\alpha$ allows them to grow larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating the model, the parameter must be specified, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ridge_model = Ridge(alpha=100)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This introduces another instance of the model selection problem: we must determine the value of $\\alpha$ that yields the best CV RMSE score.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps to Follow:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Standardize the Data:**  \n",
    "   Ridge regression is sensitive to the scale of the features, so we will use `StandardScaler` to standardize the feature set to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 before training and testing. Note that the target variable does **not** need to be scaled.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Perform Cross-Validation Over a Range of Alpha Values:**  \n",
    "   For each $\\alpha \\in \\{100, 110, 120, \\dots, 500\\}$, calculate the cross-validation RMSE score for the model using 5-fold cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Visualize the Results:**  \n",
    "   Plot the CV RMSE scores against the $\\alpha$ values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Identify the Best Alpha:**  \n",
    "   Determine the $\\alpha$ that results in the minimum CV RMSE Score and print it out, along with the score.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:** It would be an *excellent* idea to add the suffix `_scaled` to any set to which you apply scaling."
